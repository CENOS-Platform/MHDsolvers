# About
* MHD solvers are modified OpenFOAM v10 solvers (See [OpenFOAM GitHub repository](https://github.com/OpenFOAM/OpenFOAM-11)).
* The solvers are to be used with [EOF-Library](https://github.com/jvencels/EOF-Library). Prerequisites are [OpenFOAM v11](https://openfoam.org/version/11/) and [Elmer FEM](https://www.csc.fi/web/elmer) software.
* To install all solvers, just execute ./Allwmake in a bash terminal of a properly prepared Linux environment.

## foamMultiRunEpot ##
* A modified version of OpenFOAM v11 solver foamMultiRun.
* Solver for steady or transient electromagnetically forced fluid flow and solid heat conduction, with conjugate heat transfer between regions, buoyancy effects, turbulence and radiation modelling.

## foamRunEpot ##
* A modified version of OpenFOAM v11 solver foamRun.
* Solver for steady or transient buoyant, turbulent flow of compressible or incompressible fluids for electromagnetically forced and heated flows.
